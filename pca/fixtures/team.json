        "description": "Connections Neuro Services (Independent Services that I set up myself in 2019)\r\nI have two areas of particular interest. I am passionate about CE for individuals with profound and multiple disabilities and how both the methodology and philosophy can be applied in this area. I am also a qualified Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioner and am exploring how this can be used within or around CE to benefit the psychological wellbeing of our participants. I have been in the PCA for a number of years and very much enjoy the role that PCA plays in the groundwork and foundations of CE. The framework that PCA offers to conductors in supporting conductors to develop within best-practice, working safely and to the best of their abilities is so important. I also value PCAs role in creating a network of conductors and being the voice of it’s members to support them in their daily practice.",

In the up-coming academic year she will be working across 2 'core' groups, as well as having an 'over-seeing' role; supporting the other conductors in the centre and positively influencing CE practice across our nursery/primary services. Within her career she has gained experience in training; both on a practical and theoretical level and am a member of the 'Training Team' at the centre, which consists of a range of professionals. Josie is currently doing her Masters in CE and finding that studying the field at this level is reigniting her passion and commitment to the CE approach! She hopes that this passion will transcend to the professionals she works with in the Transdisciplinary Team and help them to truly see the positive influence of CE as an educational approach for the students.",
